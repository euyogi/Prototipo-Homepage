          <p>
            I am a brazilian student that loves programming, and I am taking
            the <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0" target="_blank">CS50 Course</a> before I enter in university, and it is wonderful course indeed.

          <h2>Why the page</h2>
          <p>
            One of CS50's problem sets is creating a homepage about something. It could be about myself, or some hobbie, or anything else that I have some interest, so I thought about Minecraft, because it is a game that I played a lot when I was younger, and had a lot of fun with people across my country, could live some wonderful experiences in some servers that probably does not even exists anymore. As there is some time that I do not play, it is possible that the game changed a lot and it lost some of that essence of the past. But it will be forever something that was part of my life and I really liked the gold times expend in it :)
